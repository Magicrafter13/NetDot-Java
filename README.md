# NetDot Java Edition
The original Java implementation of my [NetDot](https://gitlab.com/Magicrafter13/NetDot) game/program.

Intended to be run on a computer, but since it is written in Java, it may work on other systems.

# Compile
- `make` to simply compile the Java code.
- `make doc` to also create the javadoc documentation HTML.
- `make jar` to also zip the class files into an executable jar file.

# Run
`make run` will run the game (and compile it if necessary). If you have the jar file you can just do `java -jar NetDot.jar` though.
